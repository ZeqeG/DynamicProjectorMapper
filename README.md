The **Acoustic Location Processing System (ALPS)** by [Yodellabs](https://www.yodellabs.com/) is a markerless indoor positioning system for iOS smartphones and tablets (iPhones and iPads with ARkit compatibility). ALPS uses low-cost, energy harvesting ultrasound beacons to enable high accuracy localization applications such as multi-user augmented reality, fine grained retail analytics and next generation assistive technologies.

This repository integrates the ALPS iOS Framework with Unity's ARFoundation by providing an easy-to-use C# wrapper. 
This has been tested to work on Unity 2020.3.38f1, and will likely work on later versions as well. For more information about ARFoundation, please visit this link: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples . ARFoundation has already been installed and configured in this repository, so you shouldn't need to change any settings for ARFoundation, unless you change the Unity version.

Carnegie Mellon University's [**Entertainment Technology Center (ETC)**](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/) was founded in 1998 with Randy Pausch and Don Marinelli as the co-directors. The faculty and staff worked together to articulate our academic mission which focuses on educational goals and creative development. And we also created an R&D Agenda exploring transformational games, innovation by design and interactive storytelling. Throughout, we work to prepare students to graduate as creative professionals The ETC's unique, two-year, Master of Entertainment Technology (MET) degree was founded as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s School of Computer Science and the College of Fine Arts.  The MET is currently considered a terminal degree.
